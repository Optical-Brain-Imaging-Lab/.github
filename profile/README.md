# Optical Brain-Imaging Lab

formerly [Bio-SSA](https://www1.villanova.edu/villanova/engineering/research/Faculty/biomedical-signals-systems-analysis.html)

Led by [Dr. Meltem Izzetoglu](https://www1.villanova.edu/university/engineering/academic-programs/departments/electrical-computer/directory/biodetail.html?mail=meltem.izzetoglu@villanova.edu), assistant professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, the Optical Brain-Imaging (OBI) Laboratory’s mission is to study the functioning of human brain and body by acquiring signals of bio-optical, bio-electric, bio-mechanical and bio-acoustic origin using biomedical sensors, devices and signal processing algorithms based on engineering, math, physics, and physiological principles.

In the OBI Lab, research is focused on brain imaging for cognitive activity and physiological monitoring using optical methods. Functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) can monitor changes in oxygenated- and deoxygenated-hemoglobin, which can be related to cognitive activity and other physiological changes continuously and noninvasively using the attenuation of light in the near infrared range within the tissue. Using the advantages fNIRS technology such as portability, affordability, ease of application and noninvasiveness, brain imaging in every day environments, in the field and clinics is being explored in the Bio-SSA Lab on healthy and diseased/disabled populations of all ages.


## Current Research Projects

### Next Generation fNIRS System Development and Evaluation
fNIRS is an emerging, safe, noninvasive, affordable and portable neuroimaging modality. There are various forms of commercially available fNIRS system and sensor designs, from wireless to desktop versions. **The primary objective of this research study is to design a fully wireless, miniaturized, app operable, cost efficient and easily processable fNIRS system that can be used in the field, at home or in classroom settings.** This device is aimed to be smaller, lighter and comfortable than existing solutions, and able to transmit the data wirelessly from the sensor itself so that it can be worn on the head for a prolonged time while transmit ting brain oxygenation signals during everyday activities to any presentation device, personal computers, tablets and phones.

A prototype design has been achieved in Villanova University’s Electrical and Computer Engineering Department, by a group of undergraduate students during the Harris Summer Innovation Program. This initial fully wireless and app-operable prototype forms the basis of further development and testing on laboratory models and humans to achieve a flexible, reliable and durable designs.


### Phantom Development and Testing
Human head mimicking laboratory models (phantoms) play an important role in the calibration, testing and evaluation of fNIRS-based optical brain imaging systems. Phantoms reported in the literature are generally of solid nature mimicking optical properties of the overall human head within one layer. Solid phantoms can further be constructed as multilayered to mimic superficial layers of the head or with disks to mimic lesions within the brain layer. However, solid phantoms are of static nature and hence changing characteristics within the brain layer, such as in oxygen saturation cannot be modeled. Liquid phantoms can be used to model dynamic changes within the brain, however, existing liquid phantoms are of one layer only and cannot mimic the superficial layers of the head.

In this research study, together with colleagues from Drexel University’s School of Biomedical Engineering and Infrascan, Inc. **we are working on the design and development of a multi-layer human head mimicking phantoms that are a mixture of solid compartments modeling the superficial layers of the head and a liquid section mimicking the brain layer which provides a realistic and dynamic design.** This hybrid, multi-layer phantom can further be used in the design and evaluation of fNIRS-based brain imaging systems.


### Cerebral Hematoma Detection and Edema Monitoring & Cerebral and Body Oximetry
The two leading causes of death on the battlefield are brain injury and hemorrhage. In civilian populations, each year in the U.S. alone about 1.5 million people incur a head injury requiring medical care and over 5.3 million people suffer severe disabilities due to past traumatic brain injury (TBI). Resuscitation and triage of casualties of brain injury and hemorrhagic shock remains one of the most challenging aspects of trauma care. One of the most common effects of head trauma, in addition to intracranial hematomas, is brain edema. A critical obstacle to improving survival is the lack of methods and systems to measure, monitor, and trend physiologic parameters.  Noninvasive devices to be applied in the field to detect tissue oxygen to assess vital organ perfusion are desperately needed. Such technology would provide critical baselines for monitoring and assessment of trauma victims during triage and resuscitation efforts.

**This research study aims to develop a portable near infrared (NIR) based device for field triage and resuscitation of trauma victims at the site of injury**. The proposed integrated system will capitalize on the Infrascanner, a hand-held point-of-care medical device (Infrascan, Inc). The main objective is to develop and translate an integrated hand-held point-of-care system, the next generation of Infrascanner for effective triage and resuscitation to aid head trauma and hemorrhagic shock victims in settings where timely decisions are critical. To achieve the overall objective, the specific aims are to:

1. Design and develop prototypes, i.e., hardware, software and signal processing algorithms, to reliably detect and monitor changes in the brain blood and water content for cerebral hematoma and edema detection and oxygen saturation measurements within the brain and extremities
2. Evaluate and validate accurate, non-invasive detection and monitoring of brain hematoma, edema and oxygenation saturation changes in the brain and extremities through laboratory phantom and animal testing and human experimentation.

This project has been ongoing for several years with funds from the U.S. Army, Marines, and Coulter Foundation as a joint effort of engineers and clinicians from Drexel University’s School of Biomedical Engineering, Infrascan, Inc. and University of Pennsylvania Hospital.
